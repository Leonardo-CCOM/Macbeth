          <h1>Taking Candy from a Baby
Duncan is totally the Early Modern version of a sensitive, New Age guy. Post-battle, when he's chilling with his advisors, he can't contain himself: "O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!"; "So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;/ They smack of honour both"; "worthy thane"; and "Great happiness!" (1.2.26,47-48;55;67). Butâ€”did he fight at all? Or did he just sit around, waiting for everyone else to do the disemboweling?

And then, later, when he's announcing his heir, he can barely choke the words out:

My plenteous joys,
Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrow. (1.4.39-41)

That's an awfully fancy way of saying, "I'm crying." We're not saying that men (or kings) shouldn't cry; but we are suggesting that, just maybe, you want a little backbone from your lord.</h1>
